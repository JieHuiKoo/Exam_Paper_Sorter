# Exam_Paper_Sorter

Sorts Durham University's collection of exam papers by module instead of year, and merges them into a single pdf.

Please put a folder called "Data" in the same folder as where main.py is located. "Data" must have sub-folders containing exam papers.

"Data" MUST have sub folders named in the following format:
          "XXX 2010" where XXX can appear an arbitrary number of times.
