# Exam_Paper_Sorter

Sorts Durham University's collection of exam papers by module instead of year, and merges them into a single pdf.

Please put a folder called "Data" in the same folder as where main.py is located.

"Data" should have sub folders named in the following format "XXX XXX 2010" with exam papers stored within. Date has to be the last part of the folder name.
